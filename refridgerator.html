			<h2>The Problem</h2>
			<h1 class="mb-4">Office refrigerators are unhygenic!</h1>
			<p>While it’s safe to say the disappointment experienced from opening the work refrigerator to see the lunch you were looking forward to is now missing, or that someone has used all of your coffee creamer, or that the spill/rotting fruit from 3 weeks ago still isn’t cleaned. The office refrigerator has become so ubiquitous with being a workplace hazard that it’s a become a steady punchline in sitcoms and movies. Complaints tend to be the same regardless of industry, gender, city, or pay grade when everyone has to deal with the break room refrigerator.

			<h2>How We Got There</h2>
			<h1 class="mb-4">Designing and Testing User Flows</h1>
			<p>A key challenge of this project was designing an user flow to add influencers to LikeWallet and manage them. I started by using an interactive mockup to test a simple linear flow with our target users. The idea was that at the creation of a new campaign, the user would enter required information including the handles of the influencers and the amount that they would get compensated. The final step would require users to share a referral link with each influencer in order to track website traffic more accurately.</p>
			<div class="row mt-5 mb-5">
				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 text-center" style="margin-bottom: 48px;">

					<h3 class="mb-4">4. Share referral links with influencers</h3>
					<img class="img-fluid screenshot" src="https://i.imgur.com/1RencRU.png">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Testing the flow with users revealed several areas of improvement. A key problem was that the flow did not meet the needs of users who used influencers on a regular basis. Instead of planning and running temporary campaigns, these marketeers partnered with influencers to have them continuously post throughout the year. Therefore they needed to add and manage influencers on the go, and not just at the start of a campaign.</p>
			<p>To solve this issue, I designed a dedicated page to manage influencers, which could be accessed at all times via the main navigation bar.</p>
			<div class="text-center">
				<h3 class="mb-4 mt-5">Adding and deleting influencers</h3>
				<div class="gifContainer">
					<!-- <div class='gfyitem' data-id='BlondChubbyEchidna' data-hd='true' data-responsive=true data-max-height="600"></div> -->

				</div>
			</div>
			<p>For users that did need to simultaneously manage campaigns with different influencers, I designed a feature to organize influencers into different groups. That way, on the dashboard, users can filter the analytics and data by group.</p>
			<div class="text-center">
				<h3 class="mb-4 mt-5">Creating groups of influencers</h3>
				<div class="gifContainer">
					<!-- <div class='gfyitem' data-id='MediumBountifulEuropeanfiresalamander' data-hd='true' data-responsive=true data-max-height="600"></div> -->
					<div style='position:relative;padding-bottom:100%'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/MediumBountifulEuropeanfiresalamander' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='69.5%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Another problem with the initial flow involved the final step in which the user was required to send a referral link to each of their influencers. This step was problematic because it required the user to take action outside or platform and also required a response from the actual influencer, which was something we could not control. This could create a disruption in our flow that would impact the user's experience negatively.</p>
			<div class="quote text-center mt-5">"We've worked with other companies to put special code and features on our website"</div>
			<p class="text-center mb-5">- Target Customer</p>
			<p>After doing some technology research we determined that it would be possible to track website traffic driven by influencers without using a referral link. Instead, we would inject code into the customer's website to monitor internet traffic and correlate traffic spikes to posting times of influencer posts. Our initial fear with this approach was that customers would be reluctant to integrate such code into their website, but our interviews revealed that this was not the case.</p>

			<h2>How We Got There</h2>
			<h1 class="mb-4">Testing Market Demand</h1>
			<p>With our high-fidelity and functional prototype ready, our next step was to test the market demand for LikeWallet. We first gave the prototype to the target customers we had been interviewing since the beginning in order to evaluate their willingness to pay for the product. Following that, I designed a landing page and animated an explainer video to launch a campaign on betalist.com and test how many businesses would sign up.</p>
			<div class="quote text-center mt-5">"Could I get three more seat please?"</div>
			<p class="text-center mb-5">- Target Customer</p>
			<p>The prototype was a great success with our first real users, who used it daily from the first day they got it. In fact, we started getting overwhelmed by the amount of feedback, feature requests and bug reports that we started receiving. Three companies asked if they could get more seats, and one of them offered to sign an annual contract of $10,000.</p>
			<p>The betalist campaign was also successful. From our research, we had chosen to measure it's success by tracking the number of soft signups and setting a target of 50 after a week. The campaign ended up generating about 400 visits to the landing page, with 77 conversions to a sign up.</p>

			<h2>Next Steps</h2>
			<h1 class="mb-4">Influencer Search Engine</h1>
			<p>This project has shown that there is a clear need and demand for more robust analytics around influencer marketing. However, during our customer discovery phase we also identified other potential areas for opportunities within the space.</p>
			<div class="quote text-center mt-5">"Instagram is filled with wannabe influencers"</div>
			<p class="text-center mb-5">- Target Customer</p>
			<p>For example, several customers expressed experiencing pain points while searching for new influencers to work with. There is a lack of tools to search for influencers, and it's extremely hard to know how well they will perform without running real trials. As a result, marketers are spending hours manually stalking social media profiles, looking for potential red flags such as bot followers and low engagement rates.</p>
			<p>I recommend pursuing this opportunity to create an end-to-end platform for influencer marketing. Our vision of making influencer marketing accessible to all can only be achieved if we create tools to help companies find the best influencers for their brand.</p>
